This application is hosted on AWS EC2 with following configuration:
AMI - Ubuntu Server 18.04
Instance Type - General Purpose t2.micro
EBS Volume - General Purpose SSD 8GB

Database engine:
PostgreSQL-11

Django version:
3.0.7

Python version:

Note: DNS name will be attached to the Email and can be tested using Postman. Until further communication the instance will be running for test.
